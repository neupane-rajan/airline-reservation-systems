## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Python is not recognized as an internal or external command"**
   - Solution: Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **"Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement..."**
   - Solution: Make sure you're connected to the internet and try:
     ```
     pip install --upgrade pip
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Database migration errors**
   - Solution: Try deleting the migration files (except __init__.py) in each app's migrations folder, then run:
     ```
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

4. **Port already in use**
   - Solution: Change the port number:
     ```
     python manage.py runserver 8080
     ```
   Then access the site at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`
